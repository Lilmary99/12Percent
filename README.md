# 12Percent

Background - Personal Finance courses teach that individuals who are 30 years old and younger should be saving 12% of their annual income.

What - 12% App allows users to get a better understanding of investing by using a simulation of past investment trends. This allows them to become more comfortable with the idea of investing. To do so, our app displays vital information such as how their stocks could grow or decrease based on a 5-year portfolio analysis on a company of interest.

How - We incorporated Android Studio to develop the app and the BlackRock Aladdin API in order to utilize some of the Portfolio Analysis API features.
